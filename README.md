# Music recommendation engine using spotify API and feedback loop integration to create playlists

## The Problem area:
  As someone who is always looking for new music, I like to learn about new music and artists from various sources whether that be through word of mouth or browsing Spotify. Generally, larger more mainstream artists prevail meaning it is often difficult to break away from mainstream recommendations and discover hidden gems or emerging artists. I would like to look into how we can recommend the perfect song, artist, or genre of music given a consumer's preferences and allow the user to tailor and have as much input into specifying the request as possible and collate this in a spotify playlist.

## The User: 
  Since Q4 2015, the number of music streaming subscribers has risen from 68 million to 616.2 million in Q2 2022 (GÃ¶tting, 2023) - an increase of almost 10x. With global recorded music revenue hitting $31.2 Billion, here is a huge demand for music and therefore for the identification of new music. 

  With so much music and consumer choice, this project will be relevant to those who actively seek out new music and artists. This could include people who enjoy exploring different genres, staying updated on emerging artists, or simply looking for fresh and personalised music - It could even branch further to producers or events looking for something new. They would benefit from greater personalisation, the ability to discover new artists, more time-efficient exploration and an increased probability of finding music that resonates with their tastes.

##The Big Idea: 
 The approach involves a text interface on a web app, whereby they can input the song name they would like to base their playlist upon, from this a single song recommendation can be made which the user can choose to either add or reject. A second song will then be suggested based on the average vector of characteristics in the playlist. A series of models will be tested, however, this will ultimately be determinde by the properties of the data.

I will look to then tie this into a web app to allow the user to interface.

## The Impact: 
While the impact may be difficult to entirely quantify, it will result in a improved user experience. This style of recommendation engine would also allow a more specified and user-led music discovery experience, cutting through the shroud of mystery currently surroundign most recommendation engines.

## The data:
A dataset of 1.2 million songs gathered using spotify API will be used.
